Validate and match CFDI Payments
================================

Added validations to check if a CFDI of payment complement received
attached to a payment is valid.

Allow generate a payment for customer/vendor staring with a CFDI in documents.
The CFDI must be in the ``Financial`` folder.

**Avoid payment creation**

This module could be used to only attach the CFDI complement in the payments
previously created by the user. Then, if the payment is not found, it could be
avoided the automatic creation of this.

To avoid the payment creation is necessary add a system parameter with the
key ``mexico_document_avoid_create_payment``, and any value.

In this case, all the CFDIs with this case will be moved to the folder
``CFDIs with document not found``.
